Second Lesson Reflections

First reflection (2nd Lesson)

Learnt 2 new commands:
GIT INIT - which creates the new meta data files neccessary for a GIT repository. It doesn't create a new repository. You just type this in the folder that you want to "respositorize", can be empty or have stuff.

GIT STATUS - gives a rundown of how the repsoitory is travelling.

When you initialize a repository, I think the main thing that happens is that the GIT meta data file is created and the tracking of the files begins. It doesn't do an automatic commit though, so if
you try to run a GIT LOG without doing a manual commit, you'll get an error.

Second reflection (2nd Lesson)

The staging area is like a halfway house for files that will be added to the repository. It gives you flexibilty in that you can select what files to add from the working directory and then eases use by being able to 
batch those files for the commit.


Third reflection second lesson
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change? Not sure. I guess you 
need to be disciplined with your approach? Maybe don't change a file once it's been added to the staging
area. So that's interesting... What happens if you change a file when it's in the staging  area? Not sure.
